![Tropospheric NO2 over the UK](/images/Global_NO2.png)  
<p align="center"><sub><sub>Tropospheric NO2 averaged over 2021. Data from TROPOMI/ESA, oversampled onto a 0.1 x 0.1 degree grid.</sub></sub></p>

Welcome to my website! 

I am a Research Associate working at the University of Leicester, within the Earth Observation Science group. 


Some examples of current work:
  - Methane remote sensing for site-specific regulation
    - TROPOMI, GHGSat, Aircraft
  - WRF-Chem modelling to support emission studies
  - Radiative transfer modelling using SCIATRAN to investigate new sensor concepts
  - Automated NO2 emission plume identification and quantification using TROPOMI







If you're interested in anything I do, or would like more info, please feel free to contact me (dap33@leicester.ac.uk). I've also worked in the past to help people access satellite data. If you want to incorporate satellite data into a project or news story you're working on, but don't know where to start, please feel free to reach out!
