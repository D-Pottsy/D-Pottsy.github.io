Welcome to my personal website!

<img align="right" src="images/UK NO2.png">

I am a PhD student at the University of Leicester, within the Earth Observation Science (EOS) group and the Air Quality (TeamAQ) group. My thesis is titled "Smarter analysis of satellite data for air quality regulators", where I'm working collaboratively with the Environment Agency to explore the potential applications of satellite data products within air quality regulation and management, both within the UK but also internationally. I am also working to prepare the EA and other stakeholders for the next generation of satellites launching in the next 5 years, which will offer a step change in capability.

I've recently began to explore other remote sensing datasets in my spare time, and I've developed a sort of "hobby" out of presenting interesting or relevant Earth observation data, which I post to my twitter. [Take a look!](https://www.twitter.com/Sentinel_DanP)

If you're interested in anything I do, or would like more info, please feel free to contact me (dap33@leicester.ac.uk).
