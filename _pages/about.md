Welcome to my website! 

I am a Research Associate working at the University of Leicester, within the Earth Observation Science group. I am currently working on:
  - Methane remote sensing for site-specific regulation
    - TROPOMI, GHGSat, Aircraft
  - WRF-Chem modelling to support emission studies
  - Radiative transfer modelling using SCIATRAN to investigate new sensor concepts
  - Automated NO2 emission plume identification and quantification using TROPOMI
    
Additionally, I recently submitted my PhD thesis titled "Smarter analysis of satellite data for air quality regulators", where I worked collaboratively with the Environment Agency to explore the potential applications of satellite data products within air quality regulation and management, both within the UK and internationally.

If you're interested in anything I do, or would like more info, please feel free to contact me (dap33@leicester.ac.uk). I've also worked in the past to help people access satellite data. If you want to incorporate satellite data into a project or news story you're working on, but don't know where to start, please feel free to reach out!
