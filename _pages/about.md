Welcome to my website! 

I am a Research Associate working at the University of Leicester, within the Earth Observation Science group. My current work focusses on the remote sensing of methane for facility scale regulation, working with a variety of space, air and ground instruments. 

I am also currently a PhD candidate at the University of Leicester, having submitted my thesis in March 2024. My thesis was titled "Smarter analysis of satellite data for air quality regulators", where I worked collaboratively with the Environment Agency to explore the potential applications of satellite data products within air quality regulation and management, both within the UK and internationally. I also worked to prepare the EA and other stakeholders for the next generation of satellites launching in the next 5 years, which will offer a step change in capability.

I've recently began to explore other remote sensing datasets in my spare time, and I've developed a sort of "hobby" out of presenting interesting or relevant Earth observation data, which I post to my twitter. [Take a look!](https://www.twitter.com/Sentinel_DanP)

If you're interested in anything I do, or would like more info, please feel free to contact me (dap33@leicester.ac.uk). I've also worked in the past to help people access satellite data. If you want to incorporate satellite data into a project or news story you're working on, but don't know where to start, please feel free to reach out!
